# gitroulette ðŸš¢ ðŸŽ²

a vscode extension that makes you ship faster

once initialized, every 10-15 minutes, you will get 10 seconds to panic and organize before gitroulette forcefully saves every file in your workspace, and then pushes it directly to git whether you like it or not ðŸ˜ˆ

### How to install

- Head to the [marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AleemRehmtulla.gitroulette) page and install the latest version
- Open Visual Studio Code and initiate the command palette (cmd + shift + p)
- Run `Git Roulette: GTFOL` and begin shipping faster

### How to develop

- Clone this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/aleemrehmtulla/gitroulette) and open it in Visual Studio Code
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Hit `fn + F5` to run the extension in debug mode
- Execute `vsce package` to create a `.vsix` file
